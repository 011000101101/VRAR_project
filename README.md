if differing from the general project license, can be found in a seperate license or readme file in the immediate 
subdirectory the file is located in. \
The only exception to this are the contents of './resources/fonts/', where additional licenses may apply even if they are 
not explicitly included, but all content inside './resources/fonts/' is cleared for non-commercial and commercial use.

When building upon this project all 3rd party licenses have to be respected.

This project itself with all its original content, as long as no differing license is stated by the convention defined 
above, is subject to the MIT License.
