## Usage

First run ./precompute/precompute.py to create binary blobs required by the system.

**Classifier-Subsystem**

./classifier_subsystem/model.py provides a framework to quickly train and evaluate a model.

./classifier_subsystem/knn.py creates a K-NearestNeighbour model, loads samples and trains and evaluates the model.

Additional models should be added in their own file analogous to ./classifier_subsystem/knn.py.
